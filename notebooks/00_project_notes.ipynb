### Project Note

- **Purpose**: This project is designed as a **decision-support tool** for city-level remote-work opportunity and migration feasibility. It is **not a predictive engine for individual outcomes**.  

- **Data Scope**:  
  - U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) only  
  - Aggregated remote-job postings, migration flows, and cost-of-living indices  
  - Some datasets are normalized or standardized (e.g., z-scores) for modeling  

- **Analysis Focus**:  
  - Combines job availability, migration stability, and cost pressure into interpretable indices (RWOI, RWFI, etc.)  
  - Includes a **linear regression layer** for scenario modeling, showing how changes in key factors affect city-level opportunity  

- **Limitations / Notes**:  
  - R² in linear regression is 1.0 because RWOI is derived from the same features; this **does not imply predictive power**  
  - Scenario modeling assumes isolated changes; real-world interactions may differ  
  - The framework is U.S.-focused but can be extended globally with appropriate data  

- **Usage**:  
  - Ideal for companies, policymakers, and remote-first organizations to **assess cities under cost and migration constraints**  
  - Results should be **interpreted as strategic guidance, not absolute predictions**
