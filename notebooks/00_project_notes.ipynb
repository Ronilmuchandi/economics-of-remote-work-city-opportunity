Project Note

Purpose: This project is a decision-support tool for city-level remote-work opportunity and migration feasibility. It is not a predictive engine for individual outcomes.

Data Scope:

Focused on U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs)

Aggregates remote-job postings, migration flows, and cost-of-living indices

Some datasets are standardized (e.g., z-scores) for modeling

Analysis Focus:

Combines job availability, migration stability, and cost pressure into interpretable indices (RWOI, RWFI, etc.)

Includes a linear regression layer for scenario modeling to simulate city-level changes under hypothetical conditions

Limitations / Notes:

The linear regression R² appears high (1.0) because RWOI is derived from the same features; this does not indicate predictive power

Scenario modeling assumes isolated changes; real-world interactions may vary

Framework is currently U.S.-focused but can scale globally with appropriate data

Usage:

Designed for companies, policymakers, and remote-first organizations to assess cities under cost and migration constraints

Results should be interpreted as strategic guidance, not absolute predictions
