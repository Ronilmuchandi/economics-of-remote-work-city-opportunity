Analyzing global city-level remote work demand, mobility, and economic sustainability using data-driven opportunity and fragility indices (2022–2025).

## Spine Dataset: Remote Job Demand (LinkedIn)

**Source:** Public LinkedIn job postings dataset (Kaggle)

**Purpose:**  
To measure city-level remote job demand across U.S. cities using job postings
as a proxy for labor demand.

**Processing Summary:**
- Raw job-level data aggregated to City × Month
- Remote jobs identified using explicit remote indicators
- Low-volume city-months removed to reduce noise
- Final output represents a 2024 snapshot of demand

**Limitations:**
- Job postings do not represent actual employment
- Analysis limited to one year due to data availability
